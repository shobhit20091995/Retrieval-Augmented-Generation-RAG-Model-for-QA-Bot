# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Model-for-QA-Bot

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Financial Data QA Bot** designed to process Profit & Loss (P&L) tables from PDF documents. The bot uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model to answer financial queries accurately and provides an interactive interface for real-time user interaction.

### Key Features
- **RAG Model Integration**: Retrieves relevant financial data and generates coherent responses using vector embeddings and generative AI.
- **PDF Data Extraction**: Parses P&L data from uploaded PDF files into structured formats for analysis.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly frontend built with Streamlit to enable real-time financial data queries.
- **Vector Database**: Efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings using Pinecone.

## Repository Structure
### 1. Part 1: RAG Model Implementation
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot that can process financial terms and insights from a Profit & Loss (P&L) table extracted from PDF documents


### 2. Part 2: Interactive QA Bot Interface
Interactive interface for the QA bot from Part 1, allowing users to upload PDF documents containing P&L tables and ask questions about the financial data. The interface  facilitate real-time queries and display retrieved information alongside generated responses.
